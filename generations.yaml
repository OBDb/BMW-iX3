    description: "The BMW iX3 is the brand's first all-electric SUV, based on the conventional X3 (G01) platform rather than a dedicated EV architecture. This approach represents BMW's flexible strategy allowing production of combustion engine, plug-in hybrid, and fully electric vehicles on the same production line. The exterior design largely mirrors the standard X3 with unique aerodynamic wheels, blue accents, and a blanked-off kidney grille identifying it as an electric model. Unlike some competitors, the iX3 features a single rear-mounted electric motor producing 282 HP and 295 lb-ft of torque, making it rear-wheel drive rather than all-wheel drive. The 80 kWh (net capacity: 74 kWh) battery provides a WLTP range of up to 460 km (286 miles) or approximately 225-240 miles in EPA equivalent testing. The iX3 supports DC fast charging at up to 150 kW, allowing a 0-80% charge in 34 minutes. Inside, the interior closely resembles the standard X3 with the addition of blue accents and EV-specific displays. The iX3 features BMW's fifth-generation eDrive technology with a more energy-dense battery and motor system that would later be used in vehicles like the i4 and iX. Initially produced exclusively in China for global markets (excluding North America), the iX3 represents BMW's more measured approach to electrification compared to competitors, leveraging existing platforms rather than developing entirely new architectures."
